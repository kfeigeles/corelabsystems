    <h1>Ideas in Form 2D exploration</h1>

    <h2>
        <p>This project is based around research conducted around wearable technoloy and the intersection between its aesthetic value and useability.</p>
        <p>While exploring this topic I became very interested in how technology can be integrated into high fashion beyond just accessories</p>
        <p>and what that would look like and how the general public would react.</p>
        <p>Through my research I found that many high fashion brands are apprehensive to integrate technology into their garmets because they do not want</p>
        <p>to sacrifice the aesthetic appeal and pricepoint. On the other hand, accessories like watches and fair game.</p>
        <p>Many fashion brands like Michael Kors, Fossil, and Hermes have integrated their accessory designs with Apple and have created versions of the smart watch.</p>
        <p>My 2D exploration is centered around what high fashion would look like "dripping" with technology.</p>
        <p>In each of the images below I Photoshopped over an aspect of the womans clothing and replaced it with a piece of technology.</p>
        <p>I used various componets of microcontrollers and chip boards to replace handbags, skirts, and tops.</p>
