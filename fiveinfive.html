    <h1>5x5 Assignment</h1>

    <h2>
        <p>For my 5x5 assignement I chose two parameters to follow </p>
        <p>these parameters were, ease drop on a strangers conversation and then create a drawing of a portion of the conversation in under 1 minute.</p>
        <p>I found that doing this forced me to pay attention to the people around me.</p>
        <p>Most of the time when I am walking around I am listening to music and not paying attention to what the people around me are doing.</p>
        <p>Forcing myself to pay attention to the strangers around me pushed me out of my confort zone</p>
        <p>and I began paying more attention to my surrounding and the people I pass by everyday.</p>
        <img src="./5x5jpg.jpg" alt="5x5" class="center">
        <p>For the way I presented these images I wanted to create the same feeling that Overheard New York does.</p>
        <p>This is an instagram account that posts overheard comments that people can submit</p>
        <p>the pieces of conversation I chose were based on how funny/interesting/unique I thought they were</p>
        <p>and I wanted to chose sections of conversation that other people would find interesting and funny as well.</p>
