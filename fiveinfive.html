    <h1>5x5</h1>

    <h2>
        <p>To explore creating five works based on the same topic in five days I chose two create two </p>
        <p>parameters in which to create on work a day.</p>
        <p>These parameters were, ease drop on a strangers conversation and then create a drawing of a portion of the conversation in under 1 minute.</p>
        <p>I found that doing this forced me to pay attention to the people around me.</p>
        <p>Most of the time when I am walking around I am listening to music and not paying attention to what the people around me are doing.</p>
        <p>Forcing myself to pay attention to the strangers around me pushed me out of my confort zone</p>
        <p>and I began paying more attention to my surrounding and the people I pass by everyday.</p>
        <p>For the way I presented these images I wanted to create the same feeling that Overheard New York does.</p>
        <p>This is an instagram account that posts overheard comments that people can submit</p>
        <p>the pieces of conversation I chose were based on how funny/interesting/unique I thought they were</p>
        <p>and I wanted to chose sections of conversation that other people would find interesting and funny as well.</p>
        <p>Along with capturing funny conversations I wanted to gain perspective on the way people talk when they know they think no "outsiders" are listening.</p>
        <p>I find that when I am talking and I know other people are in earshot I am more conscious of my word choice and the way I phrase thing,</p>
        <p>by ease dropping on people my subjects were not aware of my listening and would not be slightly compelled to curve their language or stop a conversation.</p>

        <p><img src="./day5.jpg" alt="day 5" class="center"></p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the five days I found that the majority (4/5) of the conversations</p>
        <p>I overheard were centered around someone else, not the person I was listening to.</p>
        <p>This was interesting to me because I felt that as I was including myself in these random strangers lives</p>
        <p>I was also being included into the persons life they were talking about.</p>
